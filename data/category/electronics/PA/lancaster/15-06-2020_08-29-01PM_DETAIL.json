Has power indicator, peak power indicator, overload indicator, and protection system indicator, and bass module input and output jacks. Dedicated AC line cord. Cabinet of the unit is in good to VG condition, has a few scrapes one side and the bottom edge that you do not see. Front grill snaps on tightly and is not broken. Rear grill which you would normally not see is missing. Dimensions are 16\" (H) x 22 1/2\" (W) x 23 1/2\" (D). Approximate weight is 90 lb. Color is Natural Oak over extra high density particle board. Comes with a reprint of the ADS Powered Bass System Owner's Manual.\n\nADS C-1500 Bass System Control - This is a very rare / hard to find crossover module for the PB-1500 subwoofer. It is in excellent working condition. It can actually be used in conjunction with any passive subwoofer.\nCosmetic condition is very good...a little better than typical of a used component of this age. There are some very light markings on top of the case and on some of the controls on the front. It looks good overall but it's certainly not \"mint\". See photos for details.\n\nBoth of these units are hard to come by. They are from a smoke free, pet free home. The cabinetry is very beautiful and could be made even better with a light refinish. The bass from this unit is extremely tight, exactly what ADS is known for. With proper setup it will make a fantastic addition to either a set of ADS speakers or any other system. The C-1500 crossover will allow operation and smooth integration into any system.\n\nThe unit functions as originally designed. There have been no system modifications whatsoever. Should any of the drivers fail in the future, Richard So in Arizona is available to do custom rebuilds.    ",
