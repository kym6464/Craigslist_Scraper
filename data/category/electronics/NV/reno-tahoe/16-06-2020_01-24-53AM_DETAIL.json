The DISH ViP\u00ae211z is a high-definition (HD), single-tuner satellite receiver that is perfect for mobile use and supports pay-as-you-go programming. Smaller and lighter than previous models, with a processor more than twice as fast as previous models and with twice the internal memory, its compact design is perfect for RVs or travel trailers \u2013 anywhere with limited space. The ViP\u00ae211z supports one TV in high-definition (HD) or standard-definition (SD), four display resolutions and Dolby\u00ae Surround Sound. We are 20 miles south of Minden, but we do go to Carson City once a week and Reno occasionally.    ",
