One is a PL Base 2 Meter 440 Mhz Dual Band mobile antenna that has the label obscured so I'm not sure of the make.  Appears to be high quality.  The other is a 2 Meter Whip style antenna that screws into a ball type mount or threaded mount of any type that is separately grounded.  Both are tunable but are probably tuned fine if you have a good ground.  Price is for both antennas together.  They are the two on the right in the picture with 4 antennas.

    "description": "\n\nSorry, cannot receive texts.  In excellent cosmetic condition, and great sounding, this pair of Bose 601 Series III speakers is available.  Included are copies of the owners manual and service manual (should you ever need it). There is some very light sun fading on the top of one speaker grill - which is normal for 601s.  Bargain priced at $560, these are selling, in similar condition,  for $1000+ on line,  plus shipping ! Stored inside, I will bring them out to the garage for inspection/purchase.  \nIf I do not answer the phone, please leave a message. Contact me for at  \n",

    "description": "\n\nI am reluctantly selling my beloved sound system. which includes a Sonos Playbar, a Sonos Sub, and a wall mounting bracket for the Playbar. New, this setup would cost around $1,500. \n\nWhy am I selling: When I purchased this system new in 2018, I lived in a house. However, recent unforeseen circumstances forced me to relocate (a global pandemic will do that), and I ended up moved into an apartment. I used to not have to worry about how loud I had my media, but now I feel like I can't really fully enjoy a sound system of this caliber without angering my neighbors (seriously, this system shook the floorboards of my old house). I plan on replacing these with an audio setup that's better suited for the location I now find myself residing in. \n\nThese have been meticulously cared for. With the exception of the wall mount, I still have all the original packaging, documentation, and accessories. \n\nI am willing to deliver these to a location of your choosing anywhere within the Boise or Meridian area (please be aware that the sub is HEAVY, it's like 45lbs). \n\nSelling this only as a complete system, I don't have any interest in only selling one component of it. Sorry. \n\nIf you are interested, please text or email me (I will not answer phone calls from unrecognized numbers).    ",

I think I paid something like $3,000 for it plus another $125 for the heavy duty stand and another $150 for the HDMI input.  \n\nThis was a professional monitor - focus was on the best picture possible.  No TV tuner, no speakers.  I used my Receiver for surround sound.  If you buy I will give you a free set of speakers if you want them.  You won\u2019t need a TV runner if you use cable or satellite.  \n\nBeautiful picture for a super cheap price.  Only one down side - it is CRAZY heavy!!!\n\nI am also selling a cheap wall mount if necessary.  \n\nFeel free to contact me with questions.  \n\nBest regards,\nMichael\n",

Most newer receivers do not have this capability so if that's important to you, its a very handy feature.\n\n\n\n\nGet ready for intensely great music: the VSX-D711 features Crystal digital signal processing and 96kHz/24-bit digital-to-analog conversion for exceptionally pure, clean reproduction of your favorite music and movie soundtracks. And its Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround sound decoding, along with Expanded 5.1 Surround, offer a true theater-like movie experience. The VSX-D711 delivers 100 watts x 2 (stereo) and 100 watts x 5 (surround), plus component video switching (2 inputs/1 output) and 3 digital inputs/1 digital output (optical) reinforce its versatility as an A/V centerpiece. \n\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\u2022Stereo: 100 Watts x 2\n\u2022Surround: 100 Watts x 5\n\nDigital Decoding and Processing\n\u2022Crystal Digital Signal Processing\n\u2022DTS 5.1 Surround Decoding\n\u2022Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Decoding\n\u2022Dolby Pro-Logic II Music & Movie Surround Decoding\n\u202296kHz/24-Bit Digital to Analog Conversion\n\u20225 Advanced Surround Modes \u2022Expanded 5.1\n\u20226-Channel Stereo\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Movie\n\u2022Virtual Surround Back\n\u2022Midnight Mode\n\n\nConnectivity\n\u2022DVD-Audio Ready\n\u20225.1 Channel Inputs\n\u2022Pre-Amp Outputs (Subwoofer and Center)\n\u20223 Digital In: (1 optical/2 coaxial)/1 Digital Out (optical)\n\u2022Inputs - 4 Audio/4 Audio/Video \u2022CD\n\u2022AUX\n\u2022CDR/TAPE\n\u2022TUNER\n\u2022DVD/LD\n\u2022TV/SAT\n\u2022VCR/DVR\n\u2022VIDEO w/S (Front Panel)\n\u2022Outputs - 1 Audio/1 Audio/Video/1 Video \u2022CDR/TAPE Audio Output\n\u2022VCR/DVR Audio/Video Output\n\u2022Monitor Video Output\n\u2022Component Video Switching (2 Inputs/1 Output) \u2022TV/SAT Input\n\u2022DVD/LD Input\n\u2022Monitor Output\n\n\u2022S-Video (4 Input/2 Output) \u2022DVD/LD Input\n\u2022TV/SAT Input\n\u2022VCR/DVR Input\n\u2022Video (Front Panel) Input\n\u2022VCR/DVR Output\n\u2022Monitor Output\n\u2022Independent A/B Speaker Switching\n\u2022Heavy Duty Banana Speaker Binding Posts\n\n\nConvenience\n\u2022Front Panel Quick Set-Up w/ Jog Control\n\u202230 Preset AM/FM Digital Tuner\n\u2022AM/FM Station Name Input\n\u2022Auto Signal Select\n\u2022Semi-Dot Matrix Display\n\u2022Front Panel Door\n\nDimensions\n\u2022Width: 16-9/16\"\n\u2022Height: 6-4/16\"\n\u2022Depth: 15-6/16\"\n\n\n\n",
