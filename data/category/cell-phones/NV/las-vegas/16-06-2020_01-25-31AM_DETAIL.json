Like the direhorse, a Na'vi can connect to a banshee through a neural interface that allows animal and rider to move with apparent effortlessness through the skies. The first ikran makto was Taronyu, a na'vi of the Kekunan Clan. After eight days studying an individual banshee, he was able to bond it and name it Rotalyu[1]. Unlike the direhorse, however, the banshee will only bond with one Na'vi in its lifetime. It is unknown whether the banshee or its rider can bond with a new partner should the previous one die, as is the case with Neytiri's mount Seze having been killed during the Assault on the Tree of Souls.

In both exercises the\nweight of your legs remains constant; however by reducing your leverage (i.e.\nin this case straightening your legs) we are able to greatly increase the\nresistance.

She has presumably met the elders of the Tawkami Clan in the past, as all rider's masks such as hers are custom-fit to each rider.[1]\n\nShe later learned to speak English from Grace Augustine's school, but it was closed down after an attack in 2152. During the confrontation, Neytiri saw her sister Sylwanin killed right in front of her, gunned down in the doorway. While Grace saved many of the other students, relations between the humans and the Na'vi grew tenser than ever.    ",

Its main weapons are its rocket-launching hands and its \"PEZ\" missiles stored in its neck. It can also fire various lasers from its eyes, hands and chest. Despite being a \"giant robot\", however, the Robo-Dexo is often dwarfed in size by its opponents; similar to Dexter's short stature.
