So anyone who uses ANY of the Verizon Prepaid services can use these prepaid cards to instantly credit $80 to your Verizon prepaid account twice for a total of $160 in prepaid money. Or you could credit 2 separate accounts with $80 onto each account.\n\nIts like getting $40 for free because I got stuck with these pre paid cards. This would be a face to face transaction where I don't take your money until you activate and verify that the pre paid cards credit the money to your Verizon account.\n\n\n\nsamsung, iphone, tablet, verizon, att, at&t, atandt, phone, tmobil, sprint, galaxy, ipad    ",

    "description": "\n\nOn July 15th, I accidentally left my Samsung Galaxy S10+ (plus) in one of the men's room stalls on the toilet paper dispenser around 9:00am, in Gate B area. When I realized my error 2 minutes later, I returned to find my phone gone.\n\nI remotely wiped the phone, and it is on the US lost / stolen database so can't be activated. I already replaced the phone, but the memory card / Micro SD card has my highly treasured photos & videos of our visit to Tahoe and of many other memories.\n\nIvm hoping someone sees this and returns the memory card. Just costs the price of a stamp.\n\nIf you return the SD card and include a Venmo or PayPal address I will send you $200. No questions asked, no legal action. Or call / text me the IMEI # and I will send you the money. Just want my photos back.\n\nThe phone showed a photo of me, my wife and daughter on the beach of our Maui home. Has / had a black case on it. If you noticed, name & contact info as follows:\n\nMauri Galvez\nKula Lani Ranch LLC\nKula, HI 96790\n808-264-183 three\n\nSecondary number 808-250-672 three\n\nPlease, have a heart. Mahalo.    ",
