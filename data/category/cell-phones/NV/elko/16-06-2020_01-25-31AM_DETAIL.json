    "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood solid tailgate 56 3/4\" wide I got this with a bunch of random parts I bought at a auction a couple years ago make Offer I bought this for a project and didnt use it These are original GM mouldings that I bought new and then sent out for polishing. Come to find out later that they were not for my 67 El Camino but 68-72. The newspaper that polishing guy wrapped them in is dated 2001. They are the rails that sit on top of the bed and run front to rear. If you are looking for flawless, new bed moulding, get a hold of me. Remember, this is not the full bed set. Just the sides. Email is best if interested. I bought this to put on my truck but never got around to it and now plans have changed. It's used and I believe I have all the parts and pieces for bolting it in behind a ford C6 trans, 2WD. You will have to have your drive shaft shortened/modified to fit. US gear Dual Range 71-80031 No trades, cash only, firm price. I have a set of sbc 333882 heads for sale 1.94/1.50 with a 3 angle grind, harden seats, dual damper springs they were rebuilt by the previous owner I had some aluminum heads I used on the motor I bought from him so I don\u2019t have any use for these. Asking 400$Brand new \"Mopar\" cargo floor mat for Promaster van. These are a fantastic addition if you have a van without a mat. I bought van but will convert to back end to a box for refrigeration- so do not need mat. Cut outs are for tie down clips in van. Our van is 136\" WB. Photo of mat in van is older one, but one for sale in brand new. Entertaining all offers. This is a used aluminum rack that came with an A.R.E. contractors canopy that I bought used a couple of years ago. It screws into the aluminum frame of the shell. I believe it\u2019s the heavy duty version with an extra cross bar. I removed it when I installed a separate lumber rack that fits over the shell. It is made to fit on the 23\u201d tall, 6\u2019 bed version of the contractor shell for 2003-2011 Rangers, and I found out how specific that fitment is when I installed my new rack. These are actually a couple of inches wider in the front, even though everything looks rectangular. So, if you\u2019ve got that truck, with that shell, great. If not, don\u2019t bother. The rack weighs about three pounds and seems to have very little structural integrity unless it\u2019s screwed to the shell, so it\u2019s not the kind of thing you\u2019d want to try to hack onto a different shell. The last pic is the model shell that it\u2019s meant for. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking. Brand new, original carpeted floor mats for 2013-2016 Chevy Trax or Buick Encore. May fit newer models too... not sure. Front seats, back seats, and rear cargo area. Dark brown color. I replaced the original mats with after-market rubber ones when I first bought the car, so these were not used for more than a few miles. I no longer own the car. Front windshield wiper blades for the same car, both sides. Brand new GM original equipment. Never installed. Still in wrappers. I had trouble with after-market blades chattering. These actually work much better. Dealers were charging a lot to change the HEPA cabin filter, so I ordered some online. It is super easy to replace yourself... located behind the glove compartment. I have one brand new one to include. This stuff was stored in my attic and I had forgotten about it until now. A bargain at $40 for all. Selling my Toyota Tacoma transmission. I bought this for my car but it turned out I only needed to change my torque converter so I'm selling the complete transmission. Comes with warranty from LKQ for 6 months. Only 100k miles. I paid $1400 for it Asking $800 1946 Chevy panel truck project, has s10 clip and rear end, new radiator , small block Chevy, looks to be the original style bucket seats, has rare rear bumper that allows you to walk up to closer to rear cargo area, truck needs finished, It is not a driver, I bought it the way it is so I can try and answer any questions, email me your phone number if interested and I can send you more pics or info Truck is located near Boise,IdahoBrand new never been installed (quantity 2) wheel bearings for 3rd generation dodge ram 4x4 3/4 ton and 1 ton (non dually). 2003-2007 but please check the part number to make sure it will work on your truck. These are the higher quality Precision brand. I bought them brand new but then decided on free spin hubs so I never had the chance to install them...and too much time had past to return them. I will also show you how to grease them so that they will last you a long time. $175 for both or best offer. I live in Damascus but work downtown Portland by Montgomery park. I can meet you anywhere in between after 3pm monday to Friday and pretty much any time on the weekends. Please email me with your phone number and I'll text you back. sorry too much spam. if this ad is up it's still available. Thanks. This bumper came with a car I bought. there are some very minor scuffs from handling that should buff out. There is one spot of discoloration like thin chrome Reese 66559 Steadi-Flex Trunnion Weight-Distributing Hitch Kit with Shank-10,000 lb Installed and removed without towing once. My trailer has too tall a frame for this hitch and I didn't realize it until I went to hitch up. All parts present and in excellent condition showing only the wear and tear of being installed and removed. Bought new on Amazon for $519 last year. I will delete this ad immediately after someone buys it.\n",
